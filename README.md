*“One way to learn a lot of mathematics is by reading the first chapters of many books.”* -- Paul R. Halmos

# translating-books
a list of books that we wish to translate to Clojure

## Background
A few of us at [Scicloj](https://scicloj.github.io/) have have started looking into translating books again.

There are quite a few great books for data and science written with another programming language, where the license allows converting them to Clojure and adapting the text.

This is discussed at the [Clojurians Zulip chat](https://scicloj.github.io/docs/community/chat/) at the revived topic thread [#data-science](https://clojurians.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/151924-data-science) > [translating a book](https://clojurians.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/151924-data-science/topic/translating.20a.20book).

These days we are figuring out a workflow for writing books as literate (and testable!) Clojure namespaces. It looks promising.

If you are a Clojurian looking to learn statistics, machine learning, data visualization, or some related algorithms, it can be a good pathway for a steady and insightful process.
We can pick one of the relevant books or part of it and start a journey. We will help you out, and we can pair up and explore together.

Please [reach out](https://scicloj.github.io/docs/community/contact/).

## Licenses

Various licenses of books' text and code determint the ways we may use them as inspiration for Clojure books.

- [MIT](https://opensource.org/license/mit) - just fine
- [CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 DEED](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/) - free to adapt
- [CC BY-NC-ND 3.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/) - no derivatives allowed
- [GNU GPL 3](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html) - and adaptation and reuse should also be GPL, which means some users will have to avoid using the code
