# translating-books
a list of books that we wish to translate to Clojure

## Background
A few of us at [Scicloj](https://scicloj.github.io/) have have started looking into translating books again.

There are quite a few great books for data and science written with another programming language, where the license allows converting them to Clojure and adapting the text.

This is discussed at the [Clojurians Zulip chat](https://scicloj.github.io/docs/community/chat/) at the revived topic thread [#data-science](https://clojurians.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/151924-data-science) > [translating a book](https://clojurians.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/151924-data-science/topic/translating.20a.20book).

These days we are figuring out a workflow for writing books as literate (and testable!) Clojure namespaces. It looks promising.

If you are a Clojurian looking to learn statistics, machine learning, data visualization, or some related algorithms, it can be a good pathway for a steady and insightful process.
We can pick one of the relevant books or part of it and start a journey. We will help you out, and we can pair up and explore together.

Please [reach out](https://scicloj.github.io/docs/community/contact/).

## Licenses

Various licenses of books' text and code determint the ways we may use them as inspiration for Clojure books.

- [MIT](https://opensource.org/license/mit) - just fine
- [CC BY-NC-ND 3.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/) - no derivatives allowed

## Proposals for the list

* [Introduction to Statistical Learning](https://www.statlearning.com/) - R examples and case studies, but GPL license; [The Elements of Statistical Learning](https://hastie.su.domains/Papers/ESLII.pdf) by the same group.

* [IPSUR: Introduction to Probability and Statistics Using R](https://github.com/gjkerns/IPSUR) by G. Jay Kerns - GPL license with a dedicated R package - I did read some parts and it looked really promising as a way to study the actual principles of probability in a pragmatic and programming-oriented way.

* [Introduction to Data Science](https://rafalab.dfci.harvard.edu/dsbook-part-1/) and [Advanced Data Science](https://rafalab.dfci.harvard.edu/dsbook-part-2/prob/intro-to-prob.html) by [Rafael A Irizarry](https://github.com/rafalab) - the Creative Commons license [looks good](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/) (I think). The [earlier book](https://rafalab.dfci.harvard.edu/pages/books.html) by the author seems to have mixed reviews regarding the way it teaches.
