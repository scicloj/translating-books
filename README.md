# translating-books
a list of books that we wish to translate to Clojure

## Background
A few of us at [Scicloj](https://scicloj.github.io/) have have started looking into translating books again.

There are quite a few great books for data and science written with another programming language, where the license allows converting them to Clojure and adapting the text.

This is discussed at the [Clojurians Zulip chat](https://scicloj.github.io/docs/community/chat/) at the revived topic thread [#data-science](https://clojurians.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/151924-data-science) > [translating a book](https://clojurians.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/151924-data-science/topic/translating.20a.20book).

These days we are figuring out a workflow for writing books as literate (and testable!) Clojure namespaces. It looks promising.

If you are a Clojurian looking to learn statistics, machine learning, data visualization, or some related algorithms, it can be a good pathway for a steady and insightful process.
We can pick one of the relevant books or part of it and start a journey. We will help you out, and we can pair up and explore together.
